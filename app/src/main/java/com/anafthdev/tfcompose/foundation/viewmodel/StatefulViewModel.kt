/**
 * State: A type that describes the data your feature needs to perform its logic and render its UI.
 *      The state is persistence during feature lifetime.
 *
 * Effect: Similar to state but it is not persistence such as navigation, show toast, show snackbar.
 
 * Action: A type that represents all of the actions that cause the state of the application to
 *      change such as user actions, notifications, event sources and more.
 
 * Environment: A type that holds any dependencies the feature needs, such as
 *      API clients, analytics clients, etc to decouple between UI layer and Data layer.
